Fall of the Great Wall
20240212
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tick. Tock. Tick. Tock. The clock struck one minute past midnight. 
They’re here again. When will you leave my mind? 
I tried to close my eyes but all I feel is the cold floor beneath me. 
These monsters. They never leave me. And yet again, I get up, fix my hair and turn my laptop on. 
Five minutes. It took me five minutes again to start writing my thoughts. 
As my thoughts drifted to what happened today, I realized, I am sad. Again.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back at my memories these past few weeks, I was reminded of why I got to this point. 
Their laughter echoed through my mind like a deafening siren.
Those glistening eyes too bright that I got blinded. 
It feels as if I am sucked once again into oblivion. 
I was there but also was not at the same time. 
Then my mind zoomed into this one particular human. 
How can you be so comforting but painful at once like a lamp admired by the moth? 
You don’t look that good. You don’t sound that good. But, why? Maybe because of your jokes? 
Maybe because of how you take care of people? Maybe because of how instinctive you are? 
Maybe because of how well-rounded you are? Too many maybes to choose from but not a single definite answer. 
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was fine. It always has been. Being the captain of my ship is a role I am best at. 
Not until I gave way to the stupid emotions to get through me. 
It was supposed to be a happy crush but now it is my heart that is being crushed. 
When did I start hurting? Ah, that time when I saw you talking to them, bodies close in a tight, dim, room. 
I recall seeing both of you have a serious conversation, then you started laughing. My ear rang. 
My mind snapped. “What am I feeling? This is bad.” I said to myself as my eyes stayed on the two of you. 
It felt like 2017 again, but worse.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drip. Drip. Drip. 
From one drop to a battalion of raindrops fell from the sky. 
We ran to the nearest shelter as we forgot our umbrellas. Then you put your cap onto my head. 
Such a little gesture, yet, one of the memories I will never forget. I was happy. 
But, it did not last for long. Guess what? I saw you laughing again. 
You were talking about your past experiences together. 
It dawned on me, how little I know about you, and how similar the two of you are. 
You got a lot to talk about and I’ve got too little to say to you. 
Talks. Laughter. Talks. Laughter. Walks together. Jokes with each other. Bodies close. Walks together. 
Singing together. Playing together. 
It was a never-ending cycle – of happiness to you and pain to me.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all times that I saw your eyes glisten, it was this one night that stands out. 
Unfortunately, this was also one night that I made a fool out of myself. 
The static of the microphone can be heard across the arena. 
Drum rolls followed, then the melody started to float in the air. 
Nothing beats a good band performing for a great night. I was happy. 
This thing never fails to make me feel alive. Then I saw you looking in our direction. 
You were smiling. This time, it reached your eyes. 
Stress was what you ate for that week. So, it felt like a miracle seeing those eyes sparkle. 
What a fool am I assuming that gaze was for me? With everything I have witnessed these days, 
I am sure it was not for me. I was not the only one whose eyes were glistening as much as yours that night. 
Yes, I know that gaze was for the person beside me. 
Nevertheless, it makes me happy to know that you found a match. You found a happy pill. 
But, on the other side of the equation was me.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time, I had to wear a mask. 
Pushing myself to not look obvious. It has always been like this. 
Disregard what I feel, move on, and wake up the next day as if nothing happened. 
Oh, how wrong I was. That was the time I realized, the great wall has fallen. 
And, I regret every bit of it. Or maybe not? It takes time to gather mortar to build that wall again. 
No matter how much I complain, I have no choice but to do it. 
The decision was mine so I have to live with it. It has always been this way. 
Accept things as they are, then move forward. The only difference? 
This time, it is a slow, agonizing, process.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I am thankful that I feel all of these. 
At least I know I am human. And for sure, this is something that I will laugh at in the future. 
Or maybe not? Just thinking about the remaining time I have to endure the torture from both of you, 
I want to escape. But, no. I am pushing through this. I am gathering the mortar.
I am going to build that wall again. I will come out stronger and braver. 
Hopefully, one day, it will not hurt anymore.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bam! The door swung open and revealed my friend. 
My hand never went faster than this time to close my laptop. 
Blah blah blah. Too many words came out of my friend’s mouth as I stared blankly at him. 
Nothing registered as my mind was clinging to the thoughts I wrote earlier. 
My vision drifted onto my laptop. Then, I silently prayed, that after I wrote everything, I will be okay. 
If not, I do not know what to do anymore. Save me.
