Losing Dipper
20240226
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing up with a religious grandmother, rosary beads wrapped around her hand became a normal sight. A mind who wonders and wanders took that pattern to heart. A child, coursing through the world with comparing patterns, looked up once to the sky, and called what seemed to be a connect-the-dots game, a rosary. In a small town by the sea where you have nothing else to see but the vast darkness of the horizon as the sun goes out of duty, the kid looks up, tries to find that rosary, every night, with no fail. Every night, it never failed to bring joy to that young heart. Ah, how lovely it is to be young, ignorant of the carnage of the world. This went on for the years that went by. Until, it didn't.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought it was because of how brighter our town has become at night time. Never was a fan of light pollution. Neither liked crippling through the dark streets. But, no. Was it really the streetlights' fault that I do not look up anymore? Or was it the burden the world bestows upon us that forces us to hunch down and try to bear it all? What hurts more? To not be able to look up, or to be able to but not see the rosary anymore, now the the Big Dipper? Of how the sky became just an endless void speckled with big burning balls instead of that fun game as a child? I might have gained awareness, just enough for me to survive this survival of the fittest game in life. But, with the expense of Dipper.
