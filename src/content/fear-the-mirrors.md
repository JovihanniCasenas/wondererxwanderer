Drabbleatory: Fear the Mirrors
20240212
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was scrolling through creepy urban legends online when I felt sleepy. I checked the time and it read 2:59 am. I guess I should stop staying up too late. I went to the bathroom to wash my face. What surprised me was when my reflection tilted her head and gave me a lopsided smile. "Hello there my other self. It's my turn now." Then, before I lost my consciousness, the time was 3 am.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I woke up, I noticed something different. I can see myself smiling at me. But, *I became the reflection*.
